# Welcome!

Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Matthew, and I'm currently a
Computer Science student at [Magdalen College, University of Oxford](https://www.magd.ox.ac.uk/).

I've been interested in programming since I was young, and I started with
Minecraft mods as my first projects. During the 2020 lockdown, I decided to
challenge myself and program my own compiler in Rust. It was a difficult but
rewarding experience, and it taught me a lot about language design and
implementation.

Recently, I used my own programming language to create a rocket guidance
computer for a simulation game called Kerbal Space Program. It was a fun
project that combined my love for programming and space exploration. I'm
excited to continue learning and to explore new areas in computer science,
and I hope you enjoy browsing my website!
