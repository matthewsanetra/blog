import Char from "~mdx/Char.astro";

I was lucky enough to be part of the [Typst](https://typst.app/home) closed-beta,
and since my first week of trying it, I migrated fully away from LaTeX.

It features:
- incremental compilation!
- live preview!
- [open-source code](https://github.com/typst/typst)!
- *almost* perfect typesetting!

<Char which="alpaca" emotion="intrigued">
  I bet it isn't written in Rust.
</Char>

*Oh, wouldn't you know!*

**It is.**

I've been using Typst for everything, including:
- my problem sheets
- my resume
- anything I would otherwise use Word for.

Yep, not only did it replace LaTeX for me, but also Word!

To demonstrate the power of it, I'm sharing my Resume along with
its template, which was styled after this website.

Read more about Typst in the [Typst Docs](https://typst.app/docs/)!

*Psst: I'm looking for a job! I'm based in London but happy with
on-site, hybrid, and remote.*
