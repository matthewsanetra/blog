import Moomin from "@components/mdx/Moomin.astro";

Hey Muminek, I've finally got this website I've been working on published!

<Moomin which="muminek" side="right">
  Congrats! How long did it take?
</Moomin>

2 years. Two *whole* **years** of overthinking, overcomplicating and overengineering.
Two __*excruciating*__ years of having a vision and not being able to follow through.

<Moomin which="muminek" side="left">
  Ouch. So what changed?
</Moomin>

I became less stubborn. I stopped trying to make my own tools, I instead chose
one framework and stuck to it. I don't need this website to build in milliseconds,
and I most definitely don't need to make a new markup to allow conversational
posts like this one. I became Mr. Good Enough&trade; and I'm more than happy with
the result.

## Everyone has a different style

None of the templates I found on the internet were quite right for me. It was
uncomfortable seeing my mannerisms in someone else's body. I spent *two years*
putting off CSS before I finally decided to just do it myself. I've never thought of
myself as a designer, but I've always been a tinkerer, and [Tailwind Play](https://play.tailwindcss.com/)
was a great way to get started - I was able to build a basic layout in a few days
by making everything a component with [Astro](https://astro.build/).

  Is that why you have [perfect 100 Lighthouse scores](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-mattsanetra-uk/jw8rjpadx4?form_factor=mobile)?
</Moomin>

Wow, what a *shameless brag*, how __*dare*__ you. But yes.

## Start off with the minimum

When this website went live,

- it didn't have Muminek
- it had a single [Hello World](/blog/hello-world) post
- no table of contents, no reading time, etc.
- there was no RSS feed

At the time of writing this,

- there is only one character, Muminek
- Muminek has only one pose (sitting)
- still no table of contents, no reading time, etc.
- there is only a very basic minimal RSS feed

<Moomin which="muminek" side="left">
  Should I subscribe to your RSS feed?
</Moomin>

That is *definitely* not why I keep repeating the words RSS feed.

## You make do

When you only have a few features to work with it forces you to be creative.
It helps you discover how you want the blog to be, although feel free
to change it as time goes on.

**Once you go live, incrementally adding features is much easier.**
It somewhat forces you to commit.

## Next steps

I've had a lot of fun writing this post and getting these things down.
I'd really appreciate any feedback regarding this post or the website in
general - feel free to [reach out to me](/#contact).
