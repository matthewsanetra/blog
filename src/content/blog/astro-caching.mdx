import Moomin from "~components/mdx/Moomin.astro";

When you import assets in [Astro](https://astro.build/), it does something special -
it renames them to include a short hash and moves them to `/_astro/`.

It is such a simple thing but it is so incredibly powerful.
This is a post on how I used this fact to make this website the fastest
it can possibly be.

## Cloudflare Pages cache invalidation

Every time I deploy this site, Cloudflare Pages invalidates
every file from their cache, including assets that haven't changed.

<Moomin which="muminek" side="right">
  Don't you [deploy daily](/blog/scheduling-on-a-budget/)?
</Moomin>

Yep, and every day I visit my site I can see the fonts being redownloaded.

__*But there's hope!*__ Cloudflare Pages allows us to set our own headers
by making a `_headers` file described [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/headers).

Recall that the assets have hashes in their names - it means if the assets change,
the web pages will reference different file paths - fetching them!

Combined with the fact that they are all in their own special directory,
the solution is as simple as this:

```
/_astro/*
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000
```

*mwah* 🤌

## 31536000 seconds?

<Moomin which="muminek" side="left">
  That's one year!
</Moomin>

You see, I've never had to deal with `Cache-Control` before, but
when researching, I found this in [RFC 2616](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt):

> To mark a response as “never expires,” an origin server sends an
> Expires date approximately one year from the time the response is
> sent. HTTP/1.1 servers SHOULD NOT send Expires dates more than one
> year in the future.

I then went to Google and checked the network tab, and that's exactly what they do.
Good enough&trade; for me.
