Deciding to add comments to my blog was something that took a lot of deliberation.
I had a few reasons for not wanting to add comments to my blog:

- I didn't want to have to moderate comments
- I didn't want to have to deal with spam
- I didn't want to spend money on a server

__*Enter 'utteranc.es'.*__ All of the above issues have been deferred to GitHub.

<Moomin which="muminek" side="right">
  Try commenting something that breaks GitHub's terms of service!
</Moomin>

**No. Don't.**

But yeah, I trust that GitHub security is good enough to keep out the spammers and trolls.
And if they appear, anyone can report them and they'll be gone.
