import Moomin from "@components/mdx/Moomin.astro";

__*EDIT:*__  I no longer use cron-job.org, I instead use a custom
Cloudflare Worker, which I published here: [deploy-worker](https://github.com/matthewsanetra/deploy-worker).

I'm a big fan of [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.dev/).
In fact, this page is built in a limited Beta version of their containers that a Cloudflare
employee had to manually opt me in to.

I'd really like to schedule a time for when new posts would go live but I don't want to resort
to having a server processing every request and rendering (with caching ofcourse).

  Static websites are just cooler!
</Moomin>

My solution? Push everything to `main` and set up a `cron` job to POST to a [Deploy Hook](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/deploy-hooks) daily.

<Moomin which="muminek" side="left">
  D-did you just say *push to __main__*?
</Moomin>

Yep. Breaking prod is not possible with a static website.
If the build fails, it just doesn't get uploaded to the edge.

<Moomin which="muminek" side="right">
  But to have a `cron` job you need a server or a Raspberry Pi or something, right?
</Moomin>

Nope. I'm too broke for any of that. I'm using [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org/).

## Selectively generating

Scheduling deployments is only half of the problem - we must now make sure scheduled
posts aren't generated until the scheduled date!

I'm using [Astro v2](https://astro.build/) and use the amazing
[content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/)
feature, and so I just need to make a wrapper over `getCollection("...")`:

```ts
export async function entries() {
  const all = await getCollection("blog");
  const filtered = all.filter((post) => !ignore(post));

  const posts = filtered.map((post) => withUpdatedPublishTime(post));

  // Make sure most recent post appears first
  posts.sort((a, b) => b.data.date.valueOf() - a.data.date.valueOf());

  return posts;
}
```

where we define whether to ignore based on the post's date:

```ts
function ignore(post: CollectionEntry<"blog">) {
  return post.data.date > new Date();
}
```

<Moomin which="muminek" side="left">
 That's... *surprisingly* easy!
</Moomin>

Yep! And now we can even inject the scheduled deployment time! [^1]
[^1]: At the time of writing this post, the time only shows up on the RSS feed.

```ts
function withUpdatedPublishTime(post: CollectionEntry<"blog">) {
  const date = new Date(post.data.date);

  // Month index below is 0-indexed, day index is not
  if (date >= new Date(2023, 2, 15, 0, 0, 0, 0)) {
    // Since 2023-03-15, we are initiating deployment at 15:00 UTC,
    // so change post publish date to reflect that.

    date.setUTCHours(15);
    date.setUTCMinutes(0);
    date.setUTCSeconds(0);
    date.setUTCMilliseconds(0);
  }

  return { ...post, data: { ...post.data, date } };
}
```

## Conclusion

- I'm crazy and (for this website) exclusively push to `main`.
- Why? Because it *literally* cannot go wrong.
- It's free
