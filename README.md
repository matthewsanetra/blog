# Matthew Sanetra's Blog

This is my blog created with [Astro](https://astro.build/).

This is my first time using Astro and so I may not be doing
things the best way but it works! I believe the code is readable
and I think it's a great minimalistic template.

To make a new post, simply create a new file in `src/content/blog/`. The frontmatter schema is defined in [src/content/config.ts](./src/content/config.ts).
